## Project Steps  

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Remove or replace missing values  
   - Convert text data to numerical data (encoding)  
   - Normalize and standardize features if needed  

2. **Modeling**
   - Split the dataset into **train** and **test**  
   - Train a **Logistic Regression** model  
   - Evaluate the model using:
     - Accuracy  
3. **Conclusion**
   - Check model performance on the test set  
   - Review weaknesses and suggest improvements (e.g., using more advanced models or feature engineering)
